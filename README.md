Completing this project helped me dive deep into the following domains:
- PySpark
- Big Data

## Project Description <a name="description"></a>

This project is intended to find whether a person is likely to churn or not using the log data provided. The data was provided by Udacity as a part of DSND and was intended to simulate music streaming logs from a company, Sparkify just like Spotify or Pandora. The data was provided in two forms, medium-sized (~500 thousand rows), which I used for the EDA purpose on the local machine and the larger one ( ~25 million rows), which was used to create models on AWS EMR using PySpark.

## Licensing & Acknowledgement <a name="licensing"></a>
